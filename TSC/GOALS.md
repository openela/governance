# OpenELA TSC Goals

The OpenELA Technical Steering Committee(TSC) governs the technical aspects of the OpenELA community efforts.  Details on the TSC role and responsibilities are outlined within the TSC policy document: [https://github.com/openela/governance/tree/main/TSC](https://github.com/openela/governance/tree/main/TSC)

To assist the community to better understand the current TSC top goals, the TSC has decided to focus their efforts on following: 

## Goal: Build a Common Foundation

The TSC is focused on providing a common foundation across Enterprise Linux distributions. This foundation allows distributions to maintain interoperability with other members of the OpenELA and provides Vendors the assurance of compatibility between the distributions. The TSC is focused on providing simplicity and transparency in building this foundation.  

## Goal: Enhance Transparency and Participation

The members of the TSC are determined through the TSC policies. However others have expressed interest in listening in on the TSC meetings. To facilitate additional attendees, the meetings will move  to a google workspace. Moving to this service will be jointly managed going forward.

## Goal: Public TSC office hour

To facilitate additional collaboration with the community, the TSC will consider establishing an open office hour, inviting interested community members.

## Goal: Solicit contributions for openela-contrib

There is a distinction between openela-contrib and openela/ repositories. The openela-contrib repository houses packaging materials and metadata (spec files, sources, etc.) for existing projects. \`openela/\` is for development projects actively managed and supported by OpenELA members. Note that projects in both repositories may not be bug-for-bug compatible with each other."

## Goal: Publish the Leapp repository and add further features

Make the leapp repository public on [github.com/openela](http://github.com/openela) and add additional features to the project\!

## Goal: Publish future Enterprise Linux versions as they become available

The TSC will continue to leverage and improve the automated processes that make new enterprise Linux sources available as timely as possible. These processes monitor and process the source  once the associated releases of new versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) are available.
