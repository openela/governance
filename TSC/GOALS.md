# OpenELA TSC Goals

The OpenELA Technical Steering Committee (TSC) governs the technical aspects of the OpenELA community efforts.  Learn more about the TSC role and responsibilities with the TSC policy document: [https://github.com/openela/governance/tree/main/TSC](https://github.com/openela/governance/tree/main/TSC)

This document seeks to describe the upcoming goals of the TSC. 

## Goal: Set the Enterprise Linux Standard

The TSC is focused on providing a common foundation across Enterprise Linux distributions that will define the standard of an Enterprise Linux distribution. This foundation helps to ensure that distributions interoperate  with other members of the OpenELA and provides software vendors the assurance of compatibility between the distributions. The TSC is focused on providing simplicity and transparency in building this foundation.  

## Goal: Enhance Transparency and Participation

Membership of the TSC is determined through TSC policies and bylaws, but we also encourage members of the OpenELA to observe our meetings. This is also the best way to find new ways to contribute to the [TSC](http://TSC.We)[.](http://TSC.We)  We also plan to instate an TSC Office Hour for interested community members to participate and discuss.

## Goal: Increase contributions to openela-contrib

From the beginning, we've had a goal of expanding the Enterprise Linux ecosystem. One way we've explored to increase the ecosystem is make more software available to members of our community. Whereas the openela-main repositories are intended for "bug-for-bug" compatible software that makes up the bulk of Enterprise Linux, we haven't lost sight of the openela-contrib area, which is intended to host the build files necessary to bring in additional software packages into the Enterprise Linux ecosystem.

## Goal: Continue making Enterprise Linux upgrades easier

Earlier this year we published the OpenELA enhancements for LEAPP, which intend to simplify complex upgrade scenarios for Enterprise Linux systems. We plan to continue to add features to LEAPP. [github.com/openela/leapp-repository](http://github.com/openela/leapp-repository) 

## Goal: Continue to publish future Enterprise Linux versions

We're delighted to have OpenELA repositories for 8 and 9, and we plan to make newer Enterprise Linux source repos available within a timely fashion.
