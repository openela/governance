# Technical Steering Committee

The OpenELA Technical Steering Committee (OpenELA TSC) plays a crucial role in
the governance and decision-making process of OpenELA, overseeing the technical
aspects of the project and guiding its development and ongoing maintenance.

## OpenELA TSC Membership

The OpenELA TSC consists specifically of individuals who have administrative
access to the top level OpenELA git organizations. These are the people who are
responsible for controlling the repositories, assigning maintainers, and/or
approving and/or merging PRs and contributions from others.

Current members and roles of the OpenELA TSC can be found here:

### Responsibilities for Members of the OpenELA TSC

* Technical Vision: The TSC provides technical leadership and direction for
  OpenELA, defining and maintaining the overall technical vision, goals, and
  strategies for project development.
* Technical Governance: The TSC is the final word for Technical Governance. It
  establishes and enforces the project governance policies and procedures. This
  includes approving new projects, archiving projects, defining contribution
  guidelines, coding standards, and review processes.
* Security and Maintenance: The TSC is responsible for addressing security
  vulnerabilities and coordinating the release of security patches.
  Additionally, it oversees the maintenance of the  codebase to ensure its
  long-term viability.
* Technical Collaboration: The TSC represents the interests of the community
  contributors and users. It fosters a healthy and collaborative community.
  This includes encouraging communication among contributors, addressing
  conflicts, and creating a welcoming environment for new participants.

### Becoming a Member of the OpenELA TSC

In order  to become a TSC Member one must first become involved with the
project and itâ€™s governance and contribute reliably through our Git platform.
This could include maintaining projects, posting and commenting on issues as
well as submitting and reviewing PRs. Over time, other TSC Members will begin
to rely on you and petition the OpenELA Board of Directors to grant you
administrative privileges to the relevant top level organizations and provide
you a seat on the OpenELA TSC.

OpenELA TSC membership is not required to be a maintainer for a git repository
in the OpenELA project and all are welcome and encouraged to be part of
OpenELA.

### Being removed as a Member of the OpenELA TSC

Like any other open source project, write access to a project repository may be
revoked for a number of reasons including:

* Inactivity: If someone is no longer actively contributing to the project for
  an extended period of time without prior notice or agreement from the members
  of the OpenELA TSC.
* For cause: Inappropriate actions or Code of Conduct Violations as determined
  by the other members of the OpenELA TSC and/or the OpenELA Board of
  Directors.

## OpenELA TSC Meetings

Cadence of the OpenELA TSC Meetings will be determined from time to time by the
OpenELA TSC. All decisions will be logged in OpenELA TSC Meeting Minutes and
published. Anyone can request to be an OpenELA TSC Observer which must be
