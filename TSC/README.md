# Technical Steering Committee

The OpenELA Technical Steering Committee (OpenELA TSC) plays a crucial role in the governance and decision-making process of OpenELA, overseeing the technical aspects of the project and guiding its development and ongoing maintenance. 

## OpenELA TSC Membership

The OpenELA TSC consists specifically of individuals who have administrative access to the top level OpenELA git organizations. These are the people who are responsible for controlling the repositories, assigning maintainers, and/or approving and/or merging PRs and contributions from others.

### Being removed as a Member of the OpenELA TSC

Like any other open source project, write access to a project repository may be revoked for a number of reasons including:

* Inactivity: If someone is no longer actively contributing to the project for an extended period of time without prior notice or agreement from the members of the OpenELA TSC.
* For cause: Inappropriate actions or Code of Conduct Violations as determined by the other members of the OpenELA TSC and/or the OpenELA Board of Directors.
