# OpenELA Governance

OpenELA is a collaborative trade association of open source Enterprise Linux distribution developers that came together in the true spirit of open source to ensure the source code of Enterprise Linux is globally available to everybody as a buildable base, without limitations.

Collaboration builds stability, and time and time again open source communities have asked for their projects to remain free from corporate control and therefore secure, transparent, and reliable. That is why OpenELA was started as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization: so everyone felt free and welcome to participate, including IHVs, ISVs, and individuals.

This collaboration creating a common source for the base of multiple Enterprise Linux operating systems has also resulted in the creation of standards and compatibility among those operating systems. Customers now understand they have a choiceâ€”another true tenet of open source.

The Community is organized under the leadership of a Governing Board and a Technical Steering Commmittee. The leadership has developed several documents to aid the progress and mission. Here's a list of some of the most relevant:
